I am currently a fourth-year M.Phil-Ph.D. student (doctoral stage) in the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University, supervised by [Prof. HUANG, Gao](http://www.gaohuang.net/).

Prior to that, I was supervised by [Prof. LIANG, Bin](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1096/3293.htm) and [Dr. LU, Weining](https://www.bnrist.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1220/3908.htm) in my Master's stage at Tsinghua University,
and I received my Bachelor's degree at Tongji University, supervised by [Prof. CHEN, Qijun](https://rail.tongji.edu.cn) and [Prof. WANG, Rui](https://see.tongji.edu.cn/info/1379/12428.htm).

My research interests lie in robotics and embodied intelligence, which encompasses various aspects from perception to planning and control. I am currently working on embodied medical robots for echocardiography. In the past few years, I have also conducted swarm robot collaboration and high-speed drones.
